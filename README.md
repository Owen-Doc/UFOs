# UFOs
## Overview
According to Steven Spielburg's 2008 documentary, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", not only do aliens exist, but they have been visiting and influencing activities on Earth since the dawn of man. In this analysis, I use Javascript and D3 to create an HTML webpage that serves as a one stop shop for cataloguing UFO sightings across the world. The page features an interactive filtering function to drill down to find specific sightings by date, city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO. Why did I create this page you may ask? Because people deserve to know the truth that we are not alone in the universe. 
## Results: Using the Webpage
Upon running the index.html file, users will see a table of all the documented UFO sightings across the world from January 1st, 2010 to January 13th, 2010. In just these two weeks, dozens of UFO sightings were reported. Using D3, I created filter fields that users can input to find specific days or sightings. One or all of these input fields may be modified - for example, a user can enter "az" in the state field to find sightings in Arizona, then add a date field of 1/1/2010 to see that there was one sighting reported in Arizona on that day. Notice in the below screenshot that the page's console also logs the users input. There is no filter button on this page as I used a D3 event listener to listen for a change in the input fields to modify the table and log the search to the console.

I included placeholder values for each of the fields so that user's know how to match the case and style of each field. Entering a value that is not matched in the data.js file will not return an error, but the table will show as blank. User's should also note that the filters are case sensitive - so all text should be lowercase, with state abbreviations and no special characters.

## Summary
One drawback of this page is that users are not able to search for duration of sighting as an input field. This is largely because in the source data, there is no standardized duration data type. For example, some durations are listed as "Half an hour", "30-45 seconds", "About a minute", and these are all too ambiguous to perform any search operations on. In the future, I'd like to add this functionality to this page - perhaps in the absence of modifying the source data, if this page could accept user submissions of sightings and catalogue them, I would create a form that is structured to standarize how duration is reported. Another feature that I'd like to implement is to randomly select one of the sightings, and decorate it's presentation with Boostrap components to display when the user enters the page. This would catch the user's eye, and potentially entice them to further explore the page. The truth is out there, folks - and the first step in undoing the years of institutional suppression of information is to increase access to knowledge to the masses.
